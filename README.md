## What it is

This project is a site that gives the user a list of five art mediums, and the user can select which ones they like and don't like. Based on the user's selections, more art pieces are chosen with machine learning, and the more the user says what they like and dislike, the more accurate the options given to the user get.

## How to run

Go to the main page, create an account, and select the type of art you want to choose.

### API keys

API keys should be in a file called credentials.txt, which we will give to you. Make sure credentials.txt is in the right place (in the folder called credentials, which you may have to make yourself).

## Dependancies

See requirements.txt.
